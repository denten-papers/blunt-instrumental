title: "Blunt Instrumentalism: On Tools and Methods"
author: Dennis Tenen

---

I am on the side of the makers. I believe that the humanities can be a place
not just to think about things, but to do things. Doing, when done right, can
expand the scope of our critical activity, it can prepare our students for work
in the world, and finally, (and this despite the protestations of some) doing
can enact meaningful change in our universities, our libraries, and our
communities.[^1] I write, then, being inspired by the research being done in
incitations like the Critical Making Lab at University of Toronto, Concept Lab
at UC Irvine, and metaLab at Harvard, along with many similar research outfits
that routinely engage with material culture as a matter of scholarly practice.
Besides reading, discussing, and writing papers, students enrolled in my
courses create models, curate exhibitions, file patents, convene conferences,
write grant applications, send letters to the senate, draw, build, and code.

Understood in the context of the university at large, the digital humanities
(DH) are a part of the "computational turn" altering the course of all major
disciplines: see computational biology, computational linguistics,
computational social science, computational chemistry, and so on.  In general
agreement with Geoffrey Rockwell, Stephen Ramsey,[^2] and William J.
Turkel[^3] among others, I believe that programming offers new and promising
avenues for the advancement of the humanities: a set of tools and methods that
supplements the traditional research activities of a historian, a literary
scholar, or a philosopher.[^ln-dh] But, in this essay, I would like to bring
into question a specific mode of tool making, practiced within the digital
humanities and beyond, of the sort that confuses tools with methods.  More
perniciously, the kind of tools I have in mind prevent or tacitly discourage
critical engagement with methodology. To be clear: much work remains to be done
in the area of improving humanities infrastructure. The care of sites and
archives that facilitate collaboration within our community is not in question
here. Rather, I am concerned with research tools that offer the promise of easy
insight.

To put the question most acutely, I ask: Can research and tool-making ever be
practiced apart from each other, in any field? Imagine a group of astronomers
using a telescope that reveals wondrous far-away star constellations. Yet, our
hypothetical scientists do not know if these stars are real, or whether they
are an artifact of the telescope. This, in short, has always been a
tool-wielder's dilemma. Contemporary research instrumentation in our field,
from natural language processing to network analysis, involves complex
mechanisms, the inner workings of which may lie beyond our full comprehension.
As soon as the tool becomes a black box, we can no longer be certain of
received insight. To use tools well, we must, in some real sense, know them
better than the tool makers. At the very least, the researcher using a tool
should understand it well enough to know its biases and limitations.

The best kind of tools are of our own devising. After spending days at
wrangling a particularly messy corpus, I might write a script that automates
data wrangling. It may strip extraneous HTML code, for example. I could then
release it as a software library to help others who face the same task. With
time, I may add a graphical user interface or build a web service. Such small
acts of kindness lift all boats. They accelerate the research capabilities of
the field as a whole. I would do nothing to discourage such altruistic sharing.
But let us make sure that in using such tools we do not forget to master them
from inside out. What if my tool implicitly mangles important metadata or worse
yet, what if it alters the primary sources in an unexpected and tendentious
ways?

As tool makers, let us also not forget the lessons of numerous forgotten
projects, of the sort that did not find an audience or failed to make an
impact. And let us ask again, Why? For every line of code running Pandoc, NLTK,
and Zotero there are thousands of abandoned lines, which nevertheless represent
the hard work and aspiration of many talented individuals. Even in failure (by
conventional standards) these projects can teach us something about the way we
work.[^7] Much can be learned from them, but only if we take the time to
carefully analyze our mistakes. I present here the lessons I took from some of
my own failed projects. Fundamentally, I have come to believe that that the
university is an unfit place to develop "big" software. We are much better
placed to remain agile: to tinker and to experiment. I offer the following from
an incomplete list as to the reasons why:

1. Software is easy (cheap and fun) to build relative to the difficulty
(expense and drudgery) of maintenance. "90% of coding is debugging. The other
10% is writing bugs."[^8] This aphorism comes naturally to many program
managers and software engineers, who have gone through the product development
cycle. Yet, in the excitement of building new tools, it is easy to
underestimate the challenges of long-term maintenance. Academic attention spans
are naturally cyclical: articles are published, interest wanes, funding dries
up, students graduate. We start anew each semester. Software is linear. It
requires the continuity of care and much more of it as code matures. Standards
change, dependencies break, platforms decay, users have questions. The case for
the humanities as a laboratory for innovation is strong, but I doubt that
anyone is prepared to make "critical customer support" a part of our teaching
or research experience. Most departments, labs, libraries, and institutes are
not well equipped to deal with the vagrancies of long-term software
maintenance.

2. If you build it, they might not come at all. Startups know that beyond the
initial excitement of a product launch, the challenge of any new app or web
service is acquiring and retaining users, no matter how "disruptive" or
"innovative" the technology. Just having a useful tool does not mean that
anyone will use it. I have been working with a talented French developer on the
next generation of distributed translation service for several years now.
Despite his skills and dedication to the project, the website has not gained
significant traction among translators or language students. No amount of
innovative engineering or web design guarantees participation. Neither of us
has the time or the resources needed to implement our vision into practice,
which would require training, outreach, and support that we cannot provide if
we hope to keep our day jobs.

3. Some tools encourage intellectual laziness by obscuring methodology. More
often, it is not the tool but rather a mode of lazy thinking at fault. For
example: the (very useful) *nltk.cluster* module bundled in Python's Natural
Language Toolkit (NLTK) framework[^9] contains an implementation of something
called "k-means clustering," used to discover similar documents in a
collection.[^10] The algorithm is numerical, unsupervised, non-deterministic
and iterative.[^11] To use it well we need to have a way of estimating a number
of expected clusters (that's the *k* variable). The algorithm produces
non-hierarchical results and being non-deterministic, the clusters will vary
with each iteration. Both the E-M and the GAA clusterers, also included in the
module, could be better suited for the task at hand. But how to decide which?
If none of this makes sense to you, it did not to me either. Getting to the
reasoning behind the tool involved reading the framework documentation,
stepping through the code, and learning more about the underlying algorithms
(found in *Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing* by
Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze). NLTK facilitates such discovery
through meticulous notes (published at nltk.org). These encourage the user to
explore and one would be remiss to draw insight from the tool without
understanding the methodological complexity involved.

I take at least two lessons form NLTK. First about empowered use. I was able to
start experimenting with NLTK in a matter of days. But it took me months to
understand the logic beneath, and I am still learning. The second is about
documentation. NLTK is particularly good at revealing its methods. The code
base is accessible, for one. It is clean and well documented. And it contains
many links to the related research. Throughout, steps were taken to expose the
encoded assumptions. Immense care clearly went into the writing of
documentation. And I suspect that at this late stage of the project's life
cycle, more overall hours were spent on the writing of documentation than on on
writing code. The NLTK GitHub page lists no fewer than 130 contributors to the
effort.

Note that in our example, NLTK itself is a wrapper around a set of statistical
approaches (models and methods) to the study of natural language. That step of
encapsulation already poses a number of problems for research. To use NLTK
responsibly requires some statistical literacy along with the ability to
examine the implemented code. Yet higher level encapsulations of NLTK (like a
web-based topic modeler, for example) would further remove the user from the
logic. Each layer of abstraction introduces its own set of assumptions,
compromises, and complexity. The resulting (hypothetical) web application may
look easy to use. Yet, paradoxically, the ease would be gained at the expense
of added (and hidden) complexity.

Hidden complexity puts us in danger of resembling those hapless astronomers who
receive wondrous pictures from broken telescopes. To avoid falling into such a
trap, in the way of actual astronomers, we would have to disassemble the
device, gaining access to those inner-most meaning-making mechanisms. There is
no other logical way to make the tool simpler. Any attempt to repackage it only
adds another, thin layer of obfuscation.

4. Out-of-the-box tools are easy to learn and use, but they are a poor
investment of time in the long run. Methodologies improve over time. Tools
proliferate and decline in quality relative to the researcher's experience.
Reviewing the academic literature on k-means clustering at its lowest "raw"
level of abstraction initially could be a tedious and labor-intensive affair.
Not being a statistician, I cannot always follow the math. But, in looking at a
number of articles in several related fields I am able to understand the uses
and the limitations of the algorithm. This knowledge is independent of
implementation. If tomorrow's researchers move from Python to Haskell (for
example), the applied methods will transfer with the language. Thus: learn the
method not the implementation.

Getting to the methodological layer of the tool can be initially expensive, but
ultimately, it makes for a more lasting and a more portable investment of time.
Gaining fluency in widely-adopted languages, like R or Python, enables us to
reach a wider audience: to share expertise, to seek and to offer support, and
to share findings with a diverse community of practitioners. But to get to that
level, we cannot underestimate the effort required to attain deep digital
literacy. Tools that hide complexity divert resources away from the attainment
of core competencies necessary for computational research. Without attention to
methodology, we are bound to remain mere consumers of methods developed
elsewhere.

The emphasis of innovation should be on nurturing communities rather on
building tools. Hacking stuff is good, but better yet we need to hack our
cultures and our institutions. A new publishing platform, for example, does
little to solve the problems with the current publishing regime. The difficulty
lies in convincing our peers to read and to write differently. It is in the way
we cite, in our program requirements, and in the way train faculty, students,
and librarians. The building communities involves maintaining a delicate
balance between disruption and continuance. Much can be learned from the
success of the open source and free culture movements in this regard.[^12] Take
for example the story of *Wikipedia* and *MediaWiki*. *MediaWiki*, the software
platform powering *Wikipedia*, was neither the first, nor the most technically
interesting wiki software package. But in the hands of Wikipedians, it became
something capable of transforming the contemporary information landscape.
Wikipedia struck the right balance between traditional forms of
knowledge-making (the encyclopedia) and innovative editorial structures
(commons-based peer production).[^13] I am therefore inspired by *Wikipedia*
the community, not *MediaWiki* the tool.

The emphasis on community-building leads us to standards and best
practices. Rather than tools, we need initiatives that promote methodological
and not just instrumental innovation: humanities-based alternatives to
associations like the *Society for Political Methodology and the International
Association of Legal Methodology*; journals like *Sociological Methods &
Research*, *Journal of Mixed Methods Research*, *International Journal of
Qualitative Methods*; prizes and funding opportunities like the *Political
Methodology Career Achievement and Emerging Scholars Awards*, or the *Program
for Promoting Methodological Innovation in Humanities and Social Sciences* run
by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. To sharpen our tools we must
return to methodology: to formulate common questions, to take it more seriously
in our training, and to give it more room in our debates and publications.

DH cannot survive alone, in isolation from similar movements in other fields.
The concern with data processing and computation, the availability of large
datasets and cheap processing power have brought a number of disciplines closer
to each other, in a way that elicits much intellectual excitement. But to
actually make fireworks together, we need to operate the same incendiary
equipment. That is to say that finding strings within the human genome could
have some interesting applications to mining the *Gutenberg Project* and the
other way around. Biologists, linguists, economists, and sociologists
increasingly integrate their methodologies, as evidenced by a vigorous
cross-disciplinary publishing record. The computational turn sweeping all forms
of knowledge is enabled by common toolsets, by collective methodological
assumptions, and through shared standards of academic exposition (clarity,
concision, and reproducibility).[^14] DH is primed to join that conversation,
but only if its conceptual apparatus does not evolve in isolation. Working as a
digital humanist or a new media scholar means taking on extra responsibilities:
to do well by theory when doing theory, to be expert librarians when building
archives, to make things that last when making things, and to do good science
when doing science.
